### Building our application - Breaking down problems into smaller tasks

In this lab, we are going to be practicing a key skill that you will help you be more successful in getting good output from generative AI coding assistants like Amazon Q Developer. That skill is breaking down larger problems into smaller tasks that we can get Amazon Q Developer to help us with. Generative AI is very powerful, but we need to understand how to get the most of that capability. It is tempting to ask these tools to help solve our problems at a very high level (build me an app that does x or y) but experience shows that when the underlying models have too much scope with too little direction, they can provide very broad guidance which might not be helpful. In the worst case, they can hallucinate and take you off track completely.

**Overview**

In this lab we are going to take a look at how we might break down a bigger ask into smaller, more actionable tasks. We will practice breakdowing down problems into more actional tasks. In the next 20 mins, we will get into groups of 2-3 and then do the following:

1. We will take the following high level requirements and then break down it down into specific tasks.

> The business has asked us to create a customer feedback application that we can collect customer via an online web application. The application should allow the business to create customer survey forms, and then share these with people to complete. Only the people who create customer feedback forms should be able to view them. 

Take this business request, and:

2. Within your groups, break down this requirement into a series of tasks how you might do this if you were building an applicaiton yourself.

3. As you break down each task, write down a detailed statement (prompt).

4. Review the order of the tasks and the prompts - are they detailed enough? how would you make them more specific?

5. Capture nouns (the things your application will need) and verbs (the kinds of actions). This about the inputs, as well as the outputs


The workshop host will manage time keeping, and after 20 minutes we will review the output.

> **Additional reading** I recently wrote a blog post that puts these into practice which you can read about in the post, [How I built an arcade scrolling game in a day with generative AI](https://dev.to/aws/how-i-built-an-arcade-scrolling-game-in-one-day-ek8)


**Complete:** You have now had some practice breaking down problems into smaller tasks, and we can now proceed with the first part of building our application in [Part One](building-our-app-part-1.md)
